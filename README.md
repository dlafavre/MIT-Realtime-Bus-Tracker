## Changes
I changed the formatting of the map and added a little bit of color to make it stand out more.

## Roadmap of Future Improvements
I would like to add a feature that allows the user to click on a bus and see the route that it is taking. I'd also like to add a feature that allows the user to click on a bus stop and see the next bus that will be arriving at that stop.
